\description{
Perform RNA velocity calculations with the \pkg{scVelo} package.
}
\details{
This function uses the \pkg{scVelo} Python package (\url{https://pypi.org/project/scvelo/}) for RNA velocity calculations.
The main difference from the original \pkg{velocyto} approach is that the dynamical model of \pkg{scVelo}
does not rely on the presence of observed steady state populations,
which may improve the reliability of the velocity calculations in general applications.

For consistency with other Bioconductor workflows, we perform as many standard steps in R as we can
before starting the velocity calculations with \pkg{scVelo}.
This involves:
\enumerate{
\item Size factor-based normalization with \code{sf.*} values and \code{\link{normalizeCounts}}.
For \code{"X"}, log-transformation is performed as well, while for the others, only scaling normalization is performed.
\item Subsetting all matrices to \code{subset.row}, most typically to a subset of interest, e.g., highly variable genes.
Note that, if set, any subsetting is done \emph{after} normalization so that library sizes are correctly computed.
\item If \code{dimred=NULL}, the PCA step on the log-expression values derived from the \code{"X"} matrix,
using the specified \code{BSPARAM} to obtain the first \code{ncomponents} PCs.
}
This allows us to guarantee that, for example, the log-expression matrix of HVGs or the PCA coordinates
are the same as that used in other applications like clustering or trajectory reconstruction.

Nonetheless, one can set \code{use.theirs=TRUE} to directly use the entire \pkg{scVelo} normalization and filtering pipeline.
This ignores all of the size factors arguments (\code{sf.*}),
all of the PCA-related arguments (\code{ncomponents}, \code{BSPARAM}) and \code{subset.row}.
However, if a low-dimensionality result is supplied via \code{dimred} or \code{use.dimred},
the \pkg{scVelo} PCA will always be omitted.

Upon first use, this function will instantiate a conda environment containing the \pkg{scVelo} package.
This is done via the \pkg{basilisk} package - see the documentation for that package for trouble-shooting.
}
\section{Comments on the three matrices}{

It is worth commenting on the use of three separate matrices.
Strictly speaking, only the spliced and unspliced matrices are necessary for the velocity calculations.
However, it is often the case that the spliced matrix is not actually the same as a \dQuote{usual} count matrix
(e.g., generated by summing counts across all exons for all mapped genes).
This is due to differences in how ambiguous reads, e.g. mapping across exon-intron boundaries or in genomic regions that can be either exonic or intronic depending on which transcript isoform is considered, are handled.

We request the usual count matrix as the \code{"X"} entry of \code{x} to ensure that
the PCA and nearest neighbor detection in \pkg{scVelo} are done on the same data
as that used in other steps of the large analysis (e.g., clustering, visualization, trajectory reconstruction).
In practice, if the usual count matrix is not available, one can often achieve satisfactory results
by simply re-using the spliced count matrix as both the first and second entries of \code{x}.
}

\section{Additional arguments to Python}{

Additional arguments to \pkg{scVelo} functions are provided via \code{scvelo.params}.
This is a named list where each entry is named after a function and is itself a named list of arguments for that function.
The following function names are currently recognized:
\itemize{
\item \code{"filter_and_normalize"}, for gene selection and normalization.
This is not used unless \code{use.theirs=TRUE}.
\item \code{"moments"}, for PCA and nearest neighbor detection.
The PCA is not performed if \code{dimred} or \code{use.dimred} is already supplied.
\item \code{"recover_dynamics"}
\item \code{"velocity"}
\item \code{"velocity_graph"}
\item \code{"velocity_pseudotime"}
\item \code{"latent_time"}
\item \code{"velocity_confidence"}
}
See the \pkg{scVelo} documentation for more details about the available arguments.
