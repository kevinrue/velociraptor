\title{Summarize vectors into a grid}
\usage{
gridVectors(x, v, resolution = 40, scale = TRUE, as.data.frame = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A low-dimensional embedding of the dataset where each cell is a row.}

\item{v}{A low-dimensional projection of the velocity vectors, of the same dimensions as \code{x}.}

\item{resolution}{Integer scalar specifying the resolution of the grid,
in terms of the number of grid intervals along each axis.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar indicating whether the averaged vectors should be scaled by the grid resolution.}

\item{as.data.frame}{Logical scalar indicating whether the output should be a data.frame.
If \code{FALSE}, a list of two matrices is returned.}
}
\value{
If \code{as.data.frame=FALSE}, a list is returned containing \code{start} and \code{end},
two numeric matrices with one row per non-empty block in the grid and one column per column in \code{x}.
\code{start} contains the mean location of all cells inside that block,
and \code{end} contains the endpoint after adding the (scaled) average of the block's cell's velocity vectors.

If \code{as.data.frame=TRUE}, a data.frame is returned with numeric columns of the same contents as the list above.
Column names are prefixed by \code{start.*} and \code{end.*}.
}
\description{
Summarize the velocity vectors into a grid, usually for easy plotting.
}
\details{
This partitions the bounding box of \code{x} into a grid with \code{resolution} units in each dimension.
The locations and vectors of all cells in each block are averaged to obtain a representative of that block.
This is most obviously useful for visualization to avoid overplotting of velocity vectors.

If \code{scale=TRUE}, per-block vectors are scaled so that the median vector length is comparable to the spacing between blocks.
This improves visualization when the scales of \code{x} and \code{v} are not immediately comparable.
